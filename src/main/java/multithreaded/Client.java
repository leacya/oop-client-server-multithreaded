/** CLIENT                                                  March 2021
 *
 * This Client program asks the user to input commands to be sent to the server.
 *
 * There are only two valid commands in the protocol: "Time" and "Echo"
 *
 * If user types "Time" the server should reply with the current server time.
 *
 * If the user types "Echo" followed by a message, the server will echo back the message.
 * e.g. "Echo Nice to meet you"
 *
 * If the user enters any other input, the server will not understand, and
 * will send back a message to the effect.
 *
 * NOte: You must run the server before running this the client.
 * (Both the server and the client will be running together on this computer)
